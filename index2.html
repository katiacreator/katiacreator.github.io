        <p>
            My name is Katia, aka Cy,
            and I am a front-end web developer and abstract photographer. I am currently learning back-end web
            development, so I can proudly call myself a full stack web developer. My passions are CSS
            animations, abstract photography, and ethnographic observation as my primary sociological research
            methodology. I am interested in the concept of futuristic archives and seek to use code to become a virtual
            museum curator. My long-term goal is to marry my passion for public
            health education/advocacy for minority populations and my love for creative storytelling.
